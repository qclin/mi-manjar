            The project began as a romantic exchange with my girlfriend, who
            suggested episodes from the series discussing topics such as bodily
            fluids (tears, milk, secretions) and the austere lifestyles of
            Baroque nuns. My goal was to understand a podcast in another
            language and to find these specific moments of discussion in
            hour-long audios.
