          The project began as a romantic exchange with my girlfriend, who
          suggested episodes from the series discussing topics such as bodily
          fluids (tears, milk, secretions) and the austere lifestyles of Baroque

          , an archive of all 52 episodes of the podcast. Each episode has been
          transcribed with <HighlightedText text="Assembly.ai" />, translated
          into English with <HighlightedText text="Deepl" />, and highlighted
          using <HighlightedText text="Chat GPT-4" />. Every episode features an
          index table of highlights to peruse, along with citations of literal
          references mentioned in the show. The archive is a fully searchable
          database of 12.82k records, powered by the{" "}
